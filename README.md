# TOWARDS OPEN SOURCE SABER with WORKING SCORE UPLOADS

This is built from the public SS repo [forked by Checksum](https://github.com/ChecksumDev/ScoreSaber-Plugin), with some modifications I made. Fully functional with score submission, local replays and upload/download of ranked replays to/from SS servers.

## ***This build is a Proof-of-Concept! It is provided AS-IS.***
[CrazyLittle](https://github.com/CrazyLittle) and I originally shared these builds only with our friends. Now, we are making them public as they may provide an option for members of the Beat Saber community who may wish to move off the original obfuscated plugins.

### DISCLOSURE & DISCLAIMER: Read this before you install the plugin.

I **have not** personally reviewed every line of code in the repo from which this was forked. There are over 12,900 lines and I just don't have the time. I **have only**:

1) Made modifications to enable score and replay uploads
2) Made modifications to some of the UI texts
3) Read through the classes necessary to enable these tasks
4) Quickly reviewed the code for uploading replay content **however this was by no means an in-depth exhaustive review**

### ***TLDR: I HAVE NOT REVIEWED EVERY LINE IN THIS BUILD AND THIS BUILD STILL TALKS TO AND RECEIVES DATA FROM THE ORIGINAL SCORESABER SERVERS, WHOSE BACKEND INCLUDING WHAT DATA CAN BE SENT, WE HAVE NO VISIBILITY OF OR CONTROL OVER. SO USE DISCRETION.***
